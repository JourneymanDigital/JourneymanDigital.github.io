## The Locus of Control. 
Individual effectiveness of team members disproportionally effects early stage companies. A recurring theme in discussions about hiring the right talent for Stage 1 organisations is whether or not a potential employee has attributes similar but not limited to:

- Ambiguity and risk tolerance
- The right attitude and aptitude
- A 'startup mindset'
- High levels of autonomy
- Culture fit

The unifying thread running through these attributes is what psychologists refer to as an individual's locus of control. There are two types:

- Internal: Individuals believe that they can effect their environment.
- External: Individuals believe that their environment effects them.

**Example 1**
Individual A has an internal locus of control and individual B external. Both are contributing to a presentation for their respective companies in the hopes of acquiring a further funding round.

A's thought process: If the product and presentation are good enough then we stand a chance at getting that funding. We've only got ourselves to blame if this falls through.

B's thought process: It's not the quality of the product or presentation that matters, it's whether or not the investors are feeling generous. It's out of our control.

**Example 2**
Individual's A and B are working at Stage 2+ companies. Both want to negotiate a pay rise in the coming year. Training opportunities and new projects are few and far between.

A's thought process: If I'm going to get that raise I need to increase my effectiveness and develop new skills, even if that means volunteering for projects and studying in my own time.

B's thought process: I hope the company puts me on the right training and projects this year, that way they might consider giving me a raise.

## How do you hire for it?
It should be clear that hiring of internal locus of control should be a priority for organisation's at every stage, but how do you screen for it? There's no one size fits all solution. Engaging with your hiring managers and experienced employees with this model will undoubtedly help you to define some leading indicators of your own.
